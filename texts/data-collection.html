<ul>
    <li><strong>Ground Truth:</strong> 27 million daily aggregated pollutant concentrations were averaged for NO₂, SO₂, O₃, PM₁₀ for ~12'000 stations globally from 2018-2025</li>
    <li><strong>Meteorological:</strong> To account for atmospheric dispersion and seasonal effects, monthly meteorological data (e.g., wind speed, temperature) from the ERA5 dataset were integrated to the ground truths</li>
    <li><strong>Sentinel-2:</strong> One multispectral imagery (12 bands) from the best (least clouds) Sentinel-2 L2A image was acquired for every station per month.</li>
    <li><strong>Sentinel-5P:</strong> Daily swaths of Level-3 TROPOMI products for NO₂, SO₂, O₃, were aggregated into monthly medians</li>
</ul>
