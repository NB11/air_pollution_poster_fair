<ul>
    <li><strong>Ground Truth:</strong> Monthly aggregated pollutant concentrations from 491,588 station-month samples across 8,698 monitoring stations globally, spanning NO₂, O₃, PM₁₀, PM₂.₅, and SO₂ from November 2018 to December 2024 (74 months).</li>
    <li><strong>Meteorological Data:</strong> Monthly averaged ERA5 reanalysis data comprising 40 meteorological variables (temperature, wind components, boundary-layer height, humidity, precipitation, and radiation) were integrated to account for atmospheric dispersion, seasonal effects, and pollutant transformation processes.</li>
    <li><strong>Sentinel-2:</strong> For each station and month, the single least-cloudy Sentinel-2 L2A surface reflectance image (12 spectral bands) was selected from all acquisitions with scene-level cloudiness below 10%, applying strict quality masking to exclude clouds, shadows, and defective pixels within a 1.2 x 1.2 km area of interest.</li>
    <li><strong>Sentinel-5P:</strong> Monthly composites of Level-3 TROPOMI tropospheric column products for NO₂, O₃, and SO₂ were generated by aggregating quality-filtered daily observations to monthly medians, then resampled to 10 m resolution and aligned with the Sentinel-2 grid.</li>
