<ul>
    <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Multi-modal fusion framework with three specialized encoders: a ResNet50 backbone processes Sentinel-2 surface reflectance (12 bands, 120×120 pixels), a custom CNN encodes Sentinel-5P monthly composites (NO₂, O₃, SO₂), and a fully-connected MLP integrates 40 ERA5 meteorological variables. Features are concatenated with spatio-temporal context (coordinates, timestamps) and fed to separate pollutant-specific prediction heads.</li>
    <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-5P bands clipped to 1st–98th percentile then z-score normalized; ERA5 variables z-score normalized; ground-truth concentrations log-transformed then z-score normalized to handle strong right skew.</li>
    <li><strong>Training Strategy:</strong> Model trained exclusively on a balanced dataset created through undersampling to ensure equal representation across pollutants (NO₂, O₃, PM₁₀, PM₂.₅). The first three ResNet50 blocks are frozen to preserve BigEarthNet pretrained features. Pollutant-specific MSE losses are computed only for available measurements (masked loss) and averaged across targets [file:1]. Data augmentation (random rotations, flips) applied to imagery inputs.</li>
