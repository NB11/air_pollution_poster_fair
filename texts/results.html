<p>The multi-pollutant architecture achieved results comparable to those of Scheibenreil et al. for NO₂ (R² = 0.50) and good values for O₃ (R² = 0.51).</p>

<p>PM₁₀ prediction proved feasible (R² = 0.29) by exploiting visual features (e.g., construction sites), whereas PM₂.₅ performance was limited (R² = 0.16), likely due to the backbone abstracting away necessary short-wavelength spectral interactions.</p>

<p>Finally, the model failed to generalize for SO₂ (R² &lt; 0) due to the extreme sparsity of emission sources.</p>
